# Discovery different programming languages at STM32 discovery board 

This is a tutorial on how to run codes from different languages on STM32 discovery board. We included 

+ [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) 
+ [mbedOS](https://os.mbed.com/mbed-os/) 
+ [Arduino](https://docs.arduino.cc/)

 to make the different concepts available for teaching and learning purposes. The implementation was done on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS in combination with an [STM32 L475E-OTO01A1](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html) board.

The implementation can be realised in 3 formats:
+ native on your computer based on CLI tools
+ in a Docker container
+ in a [Edrys](https://edrys.org/) laboratory environment as remote lab.

The whole documentation of the installation is available as LiaScript course on [STM32 programming by CLI](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianZug/STM_programming_by_CLI/main/documentation.md).
